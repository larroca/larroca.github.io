					            I am an evolutionary biologist integrating -omics and computer vision tools to ask fundamental questions related to the interplay between animal behavior and brain evolution. I am currently a Researcher at the Department of Ecology and Genetics in Uppsala University, funded by the Birgitta Sintring Foundation and the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.
